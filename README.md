### Attempted implementation of Liquid Neural Networks implementation in Rust
[Work in progress]

Uploaded research papers from MIT's CSAIL to ChatGPT and got it to enumerate implementation steps before going about 
implementing it in Rust.
See this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNkrjVIcuk) for more on LNN's.
Research papers here: [Robust Flight Navigation with Liquid Neural Networks](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/144657),
here: [Liquid Time-constant Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04439.pdf), 
and here: [Liquid Structural State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12951.pdf)
I've also added spectral condition logic per this paper: [A Spectral Condition for Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17813.pdf)

Primarily, this is an exercise in:
1. Learning Rust
2. Learning about neural networks
3. Learning about liquid neural networks
4. Learning about the Rust ecosystem for machine learning

Next steps:

- [ ] Continue to implement the network
- [ ] Write a simple PoC/example to validate the implementation
- [ ] Add tests

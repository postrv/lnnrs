### Attempted implementation of Liquid Neural Networks implementation in Rust
[Work in progress]

Uploaded research papers from MIT's CSAIL to ChatGPT and got it to enumerate implementation steps before going about 
implementing it in Rust.

Primarily, this is an exercise in:
1. Learning Rust
2. Learning about neural networks
3. Learning about liquid neural networks
4. Learning about the Rust ecosystem for machine learning

Next steps:

- [ ] Continue to implement the network
- [ ] Write a simple PoC/example to validate the implementation
- [ ] Add tests
